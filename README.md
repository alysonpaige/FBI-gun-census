# US Census Data on Guns

## Introduction
This data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The NICS is used to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. The data has been supplemented with state level data from census.gov.

We will conduct an analysis of US census data in relation to the FBI's NICS gun data by taking a micro approach and focusing on the state of Maryland.

## Libraries
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

### Future Improvements
* Use functions to avoid repetitive coding
* Use `.describe()` function to present the summary of statistics for each plot or figure
* Modify research question 2 display to a pie chart
* For research question 3, add comparison of men and women. Rephrase question to "Gender Demographics of Maryland's Gun Per Capita"
